/**
 * Semaphore.ts (Rebranded as Resource Lock Manager)
 *
 * A classic counting semaphore (Resource Lock Manager), implemented from scratch (no library)
 * so the OS-concept mapping is explicit and demoable in a viva:
 *
 *   wait(S)/P(S)   -> acquire()
 *   signal(S)/V(S) -> release()
 *
 * Internally it keeps:
 *   - `count`   : number of currently available instances (like free frames)
 *   - `waiters` : a FIFO queue of blocked callers (the "waiting queue"
 *                 analogue from process scheduling - callers are resumed
 *                 in arrival order, i.e. FCFS at the lock manager level).
 *
 * Every acquire() that can't be satisfied immediately returns a Promise
 * that only resolves once release() hands it a slot - this is exactly
 * how a process blocks on a resource lock manager and gets woken by the scheduler.
