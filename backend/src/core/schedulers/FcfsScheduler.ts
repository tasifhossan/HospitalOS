/**
 * FcfsScheduler.ts
 *
 * First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling implementation.
 *
 * OS Analogue:
 * - FCFS Scheduling = Non-preemptive FIFO scheduling.
 *   This is the simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. Processes are dispatched
 *   in the exact order they arrive in the ready queue.
 *
 * Weakness / Viva Talking Points:
 * - **Convoy Effect / Head-of-Line (HOL) Blocking**:
 *   If a process requesting intensive resources or having a very long treatment
 *   duration (CPU burst) is at the front of the queue, all subsequent processes
 *   (even quick, low-resource, or critical emergency processes) are blocked
 *   waiting for it to finish.
 * - **No Priority Support**:
 *   A critical emergency patient (HIGH priority) arriving 1ms after a routine
 *   checkup patient (LOW priority) must wait behind them. This simulates a lack
 *   of priority queueing or preemptive scheduling, illustrating why real-time OS
 *   kernels require priority-based scheduling with preemption and aging.
