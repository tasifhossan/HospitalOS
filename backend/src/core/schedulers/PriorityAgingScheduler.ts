/**
 * PriorityAgingScheduler.ts
 *
 * Dynamic Priority scheduling with Aging anti-starvation mechanism.
 *
 * OS Analogue:
 * - Dynamic Priority Scheduling w/ Aging:
 *   In pure priority scheduling, lower-priority tasks can starve indefinitely
 *   if there is a continuous stream of higher-priority tasks. To prevent this,
 *   real-time operating systems (like Windows or Linux) implement "Aging".
 *   As a process waits in the READY queue, its dynamic priority is periodically
 *   boosted (increased). Eventually, its priority becomes high enough to preempt
 *   or run before newer high-priority processes, guaranteeing bounded wait times.
 * - Dynamic Priority Recalculation:
 *   The scheduler re-calculates the dynamic/effective priority of every waiting
 *   process at each scheduling tick (dispatch cycle) because wait times are
 *   constantly advancing.
